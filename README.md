# Hi there, I'm Nicolas ðŸ‘‹

My coding journey began at the age of 8, and I've been passionate about building and creating with technology ever since.

Right now, I'm diving deep into the world of **Generative AI**, exploring the vast capabilities of Local LLMs and building new applications with them.

### ðŸš€ My Current Focus

* **Local LLMs:** Experimenting with models like Gemma, Phi, Llama, Mistral, Qwen.
* **Generative AI:** Exploring the use of generative AI to accelerate game development.
* **Fun Projects:** Working together with AI to build projects I would otherwise never be able to build alone!
