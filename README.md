# Hi there, I'm Nicolas ðŸ‘‹

My coding journey began at the age of 8 with the Scratch game engine, and I've been passionate about building and creating with technology ever since.

Right now, I'm diving deep into the world of **Generative AI**, exploring the vast capabilities of Local LLMs and building new applications with them.
